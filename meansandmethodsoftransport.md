Historical method of transporting: Trains played a big role in history because the trains were one of the ways to transport
goods and people. trains were very important because it transported much materials that we use now.

Modern method of transporting: Vehicles are an important way of transporting because we now rely on vehicles to take us from 
point A to point B and in used for other reasons too.

Futuristic methods of transporting: I am hoping for the futuristic vehicles would be better and safer to use because thereare accidents that
occur for many reasons and there should be vehicles to prevent that. There could be upcoming flying cars and futuristic looking
plains.

Extreme methods of transporting: There are cool machines that are like a skateboard but has like sensors for your self to control
it and its very cool. It's extreme because you could do much things with it that makes it extreme.
